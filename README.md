# odin-recipes

    This project is the first of many in order to improve and sharpen my webbuilding skills through self-study.
    By the end of this project, I'll have displayed competency in core HTML skills (ie. lists, images, and text).


Self Reflection:
    This project, although simple and bland in terms of design, has really cemented my desire to keep pushing 
    forward with my coding journey.  It was very enjoyable to watch the webpage come to life with every line
    and I look forward to what I'll be able to create in the future!
