        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Neutral oil(such as vegetable or canola oil)</li>
                <li>2 medium onions (very thinly sliced)</li>
                <li>1 pound very thinly sliced beef (450g, fatty beef chuck or ribeye)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup dashi stock (can also substitute beef or chicken stock)</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked white rice (short grain or medium grain preferred)</li>
                <li>1 scallion (chopped)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook 
                    the sliced onions for about 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
                <li>Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add 
                    the mirin, soy sauce, and stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 
                    minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick 
                    skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny!</li>
                <li>When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among 4 bowls, and top with 
                    the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using.</li>
            </ol>
